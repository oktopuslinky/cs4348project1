I need to write a program that essentially acts as a encrypter/decrypter and logs all actions to a file, along with a driver program to use a menu. It will need to be sensitive to a few commands, which I can do by declaring a list of valid values in Python. Due to my familiarity with the language and its efficiency in writing and debugging, I will be using Python for this project. I will have 3 files that will work with each other: logger, encryption, and driver. The driver file will be the main file used for running the project. However, the encryption file will also be able to be used standalone for encryption testing.

After finishing the first devlog entry, I want to now create files where the programs will live. During this session, I plan to create the files for the programs and declare all functions necessary to give direction to how I want to complete this project. I will also write what each function does, ensuring that I can look back at this in the next session and immediately know what to write. I will leave the content inside of the functions for the next sections.
